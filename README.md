# stream-flows

## About the project
The idea behind stream-flows is to create an easy way to check the flows of rivers in colorado, maybe one day, across the USA. 
In addition to an easy way to search for and view flows, it will also provide an easy way to view data like weather, location, historical data. 

Eventually, it would be nice to integrate data with the colorado fishing atlas so speicies can be listed if applicable. 

Depending on general feedback from the community, I'd like to create the abiltity to have profiles, favorite rivers, like rivers, comment on rivers/sections, get alerted about flow increases or decreases.
